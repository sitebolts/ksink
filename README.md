# ksink
Python has everything but the kitchen sink. _That's where we come in._

ksink is a collection of miscellaneous Python helper functions. It's by no means a specialized library, but it can come in handy at times.

## Installation

You can install ksink using pip:

    pip install ksink

If you'd rather not add a new dependency to your project, then feel free to copy ksink's functions directly into your code instead. ksink's functions are generally meant to be as self-contained as possible, so adding them into your project should be simple.
